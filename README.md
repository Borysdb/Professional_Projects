## Project Description
We were sad to learn that Grandmaâ€™s recent password was hacked!
To help her in better securing her online accounts, we decided to create Strong Passwords Generator.

## Rules
Strong Passwords Generator is based on below input coming from the user (Grandma):
1 word that is familiar to her (max 8 characters)
1 important year from her life (max 4 characters, in example 1989)

Input is transformed into string, that is later alternated following below format:
- 1 letter of word
- 1 digit of number
- 1 additional special character (depending on the lengths of the word might be more by the end)

In example:
 
 User INPUT:
Word : damian
Year : 1995

 Python OUTPUT (password):
D 1 \ A 9 / M 9 : I 5 *a ? N < >

## Workflow
1. General Planning
2. Game Planning
3. Coding
4. Implementation and Quality Check
5. Final Presentation

## Organization
We were working together on each aspect of the project, as it was our first real one.

We have used:
1. Jira software for planning with its Roadmap / Backlog / Board functionalities
2. https://www.diagrams.net/ to creat Flow Chart
3. Google Slides for presentation
